# Lil Patchy

This web extension works with a compatible Fission Application to enable saving / archiving web pages directly to IPFS. 

Lil Patchy captures the following information when `saving` a page:

* a full page screenshot of the page
* some web page meta-data 
* the time of the capture
* [ eventually ] the full article text and additional text content from the page.
