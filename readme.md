# Lil Patchy

This web extension works with a compatible Fission Application to enable saving / archiving web pages directly to IPFS. 

Lil Patchy captures the following information when `saving` a page:

* a full page screenshot of the page
* some web page meta-data 
* the time of the capture
* [ eventually ] the full article text and additional text content from the page.


### TODO:

* [] light re-factoring
* [] get github action passing ( skip tests for now )
* [] capture target page after opening the web app
* [] capture target page contents and parse for metadata
* [] parse target page for article text?
* [] parse target page for recipe?
* [] investigate using [browser polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill#installation)
* [] actually write and run tests?
